## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Publish with npm provenance.

  0.1.0 shipped unsigned. `publishConfig.provenance` is read by npm, but this is a
  pnpm workspace, so `changeset publish` shells out to `pnpm publish` — which has no
  provenance support at all and silently ignored the field.

  The registry now trusts this repository's `release.yml` directly through OIDC, so
  no token is exchanged and npm attaches the attestation itself. Nothing about the
  packaged code changed; this release exists so the published artifact can be traced
  back to the commit that built it.
